    /// CameraControlControl disables a CameraControl_Ver2 object and
    /// do its work instead. It's meant to be attached to a GameObject
    /// to which a CameraControl_Ver2 is already attached.
    ///
    /// The CameraControl_Ver2 implments a camera that can be rotated,
    /// zoomed and moved with a mouse, and is used in H scenes and in Maker.
    /// It's also responsible for "map masking", a feature that hides
    /// walls that blocks the view of the character.
    ///
    /// In VR, these features are not only unnecessary but are harmful,
    /// because the control features fight with Unity's attempt to
    /// set the camera position, and map masking causes random parts
    /// of walls to dissappear.
    ///
    /// For this reason we want to disable almost all of its
    /// functionalities, except that we want to keep its ability to unlock
    /// cursor. We also ensure that the controlled camera always has the same
    /// transform as the VR camera, so that (1) characters can correctly look
    /// at the camera, and (2) the directional light, which is a child of the
    /// main camera, has the right orientation.
